## Overview

Auto Revert X is a project featuring a remote control car outfitted with a PCB housing a Raspberry Pi 3B, battery, IR sensors, and various electrical components. When directional commands (forward, left, right) are issued via software, the car moves accordingly. Upon activating the reverse button in the software, the car retraces its path in reverse, navigating the same route it initially followed.

why do we need Auto Revert X ?

1.Efficiency: It enhances the efficiency of navigation tasks by allowing the car to retrace its path in reverse, saving time and effort.

2.Safety: The inclusion of IR sensors enhances safety by detecting obstacles and avoiding collisions during operation.

3.Convenience: Remote control via software provides convenience, allowing users to maneuver the car from a distance without direct physical interaction.

or some people are just bad at reversing  
Auto Revert X help users who may struggle with the task of reversing a vehicle manually. By automating this process, the project simplifies car navigation for individuals of all skill levels, making it accessible and user-friendly.

## Build Instructions for Raspberry Pi

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohailjaffer/UofG_ENG5220_Team.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd UofG_ENG5220_Team
   ```

3. **Create a Build Directory:**
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Configure the Build:**
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

5. **Build the Project:**
   ```
   make
   ```

6. **Run the Executable:**
   ```
   ./RevAsst_Exec
   ```

## Build Instructions for Python Software

To build the software and run the Robot Control application from the provided GitHub repository, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   You can clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sohailjaffer/UofG_ENG5220_Team.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd UofG_ENG5220_Team/PC_App
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. For Python-based applications, you may need to install PyQt5. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the Python script to run the Robot Control application:
   ```
   python3 robot_control.py
   ```
5. **Insert IP address**   To insert the IP address into the code, you need to replace the placeholder `'192.168.1.185'` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi. Here's the command to do that using a text editor like `sed`:

```bash
sed -i 's/192.168.1.185/YOUR_IP_ADDRESS_HERE/g' robot_control.py
```

Replace `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS_HERE` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi. This command will replace all occurrences of `'192.168.1.185'` in the `robot_control.py` file with your specified IP address.

6. **Interact with the Application:**
   Once the application window opens, you can use the buttons to control the robot. Press the buttons for Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Terminate Connection, Start Recording, and AutoRevert to send commands to the robot via the established socket connection.

7. **Terminate the Connection:**
   To terminate the connection with the robot, click the "Terminate Connection" button.

8. **Close the Application:**
   Close the application window when finished controlling the robot.


Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, along with the necessary libraries mentioned in the `robot_control.py` script.
