## Overview

This project implements a reverse assistance system for a car using ultrasonic sensors, a rotary encoder for wheel speed measurement, and a Raspberry Pi for control. The system records user inputs during forward movement and utilizes this data to assist the car in navigating backward in tight spaces.

## Features

- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Accurate obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors for safe navigation.
- **Rotary Encoder:** Precise measurement of wheel speed for effective control.
- **Data Logging:** Record and analyze user inputs and wheel speed during forward movement.
- **Reverse Assistance Algorithm:** Intelligent algorithm for safe and reliable reverse navigation.
- **Safety Features:** Collision prevention mechanisms, emergency stops, and obstacle detection.
- **Raspberry Pi Control:** Utilize the Raspberry Pi for overall control and coordination.
